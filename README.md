# A Simple Spooky Blog (its almost holloween)

This is a simple blog that asks you to sign in to the website, create an article, and post it with a specific time code. It has a navigation on the side with information that is important, and your previous blog posts with their timecodes. You are then able to sign out of the website as well.
